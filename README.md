## Final Project Team Members:

•	Assigned Role - Square (Repository): Kofi

•	Assigned Role - Triangle (Machine Learning): John

•	Assigned Role - Circle (Database): Ana


## Mode of Communication: 


Slack DM - All team members are on different work schedules and time zones. Group Messaging in Slack, currently, seems like a good communication source and outlet. We are also utilizing Zoom sessions as well.


## Data Resources:


•	General Statistics (Population, GDP, etc.): The World Bank DataBank

•	Global Emissions: Our World in Data

•	USA Emissions: U.S. Energy Information Administration

•	Global Temperature: Kaggle

•	USA Temperature: National Centers for Environmental Information

•	Disasters/Extreme Weather: EM-DAT International Disasters Database


## Overview of the Project:


We chose climate change for our final project because it is a very important issue that affects everyone on the planet. Rising temperatures, extreme weather, and natural disasters are experienced globally each year. Some studies have shown that the planet will reach a temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050. These changes in our environment indicate a need for adaptability over time across the globe. 
Data has been collected to better understand the nature of climate change as it relates to population growth, greenhouse gases, and temperature. Our group’s analysis hopes to determine the following:

•	How have emissions changed over time?

•	Is there a correlation between population growth and climate change?

•	How does temperature and rate of emissions relate to extreme weather?

•	What countries are most at-risk of climate change?

•	Will the Earth’s temperature reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050? Will Tucson reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050?
