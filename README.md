# The Global Impact of Climate Change

Final Project Team Members:

Assigned Role - Square (Repository): Kofi

Assigned Role - Triangle (Machine Learning): John

Assigned Role - Circle (Database): Ana


Mode of Communication: Slack DM - All team members are on different work schedules and time zones.  Group Messaging in Slack, at this time, seems like a good communication source and outlet. We are also utilizing Zoom sessions as well.

Data Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) & Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com)

The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2020. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available. Data are based on the publicly available GISTEMP data, the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS).


Overview of the Project

We chose cimate change for our final project because it is a very important issue that affects everyone on the planet. 
Each year, the temperature on the planet rises causing a domino effects of natural disasters and catastrophes.  Some studies have shown that the planet will reach a temperature of 150 dgrees fahrenheit by the year 2050.  We have collected several data sets to determine if that is indeed true.
