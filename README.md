# Final Project: Climate Change



 

## Final Project Team Members:

•	Assigned Role - Square (Repository): Kofi

•	Assigned Role - Triangle (Machine Learning): John

•	Assigned Role - Circle (Database): Ana


## Mode of Communication: 


Slack DM - All team members are on different work schedules and time zones. Group Messaging in Slack, currently, seems like a good communication source and outlet. We are also utilizing Zoom sessions as well.


## Data Resources:


•	General Statistics (Population, GDP, etc.): The World Bank DataBank

•	Global Emissions: Our World in Data

•	USA Emissions: U.S. Energy Information Administration

•	Global Temperature: Kaggle

•	USA Temperature: National Centers for Environmental Information

•	Disasters/Extreme Weather: EM-DAT International Disasters Database


## Overview of the Project:


The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2020. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal, and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available. Data are based on the publicly available GISTEMP data, the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS).


We chose climate change for our final project because it is a very important issue that affects everyone on the planet. Rising temperatures, extreme weather, and natural disasters are experienced globally each year. Some studies have shown that the planet will reach a temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050. These changes in our environment indicate a need for adaptability over time across the globe. Data has been collected to better understand the nature of climate change as it relates to population growth, greenhouse gases, and temperature. Our group’s analysis hopes to determine the following:


• How have emissions changed over time?

• Is there a correlation between population growth and climate change?

• How does temperature and rate of emissions relate to extreme weather?

• What countries are most at-risk of climate change?

• Will the Earth’s temperature reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050? Will Tucson reach   150 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050?

## Results/Deliverables

• How have emissions changed over time?

Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. It is widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention globally.

In the chart above (Average Global Emissions Overtime) we see the average growth of global emissions from year 2000 to 2013. 

We see that at the beginning of the year 2000, CO2 emissions were very low. Growth in emissions was still relatively slow until 2001. By 2013 the world had emitted an average emission of 600 million metric tons of CO2. 

We can also see that while emissions from CO2 have increased, emissions from Methane and Nitrous Oxide have remained stabilized with very low emissions throughout the years.

In the chart above (Average Global CO2 Emissions) we can see the average growth of CO2 emissions from year 1950 to 2019. In this chart we see the growth of CO2 emissions from 1950 through to 2019.

In 1950 the world emitted about 120 million metric tons of CO2. By 2019 this has almost quadrupled, reaching about 580 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.

In the chart above (Change in CO2 Emissions by Country) we see the growth of global emissions by country from year 1950 to 2015.

Looking at this interactive chart shows the breakdown of global CO2 emissions by Country.

We see that until well into the 20th century, global emissions were dominated by the United States. In 1900, more of the emissions were produced in US, Russia, and China. Even In 1950, United States and Russia accounted for more than 85% of emissions each year.

In the second half of the 20th century, we see a significant rise in emissions most notably China claiming dominance over United States. We also see a significant rise in emissions in India whiles United States starts to produce low emissions.
