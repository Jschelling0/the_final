Overview of the Project

We chose cimate change for our final project because it is a very important issue that affects everyone on the planet. 
Each year, the temperature on the planet rises causing a domino effects of natural disasters and catastrophes.  Some studies have shown that the planet will reach a temperature of 150 dgrees fahrenheit by the year 2050. 
We have collected several data sets to determine if that is indeed true.
